# Tetris_game_JS
A simple Tetris game, similar to the ones most of us have played when we were younger. I built this project by following a freecodecamp.org tutorial to further expand my knowledge in Javascript.

- Move the tetrominoes down, left and right by clicking the respective arrow keys in your keyboard.
- Change the rotation of the tetromino by clicking the up arrow key in your keyboard.
- The shape of the tetromino coming next is displayed in the mini-grid.
