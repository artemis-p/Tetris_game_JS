# Tetris_game_JS
A simple Tetris game, similar to the ones most of us have played when we were younger. I decided to built this project, in order to understand how to write functions in JS properly, but also, because this was my first attempt in writing semantic HTML.

## Visit the web app
You can find the deployed app in the following link: https://artemis-p.github.io/Tetris_game_JS/

## How to play
- Hit the 'Start/Pause' button on the website to start playing the game.
- Move the tetrominoes down, left and right by clicking the respective arrow keys in your keyboard.
- Change the rotation of the tetromino by clicking the up arrow key in your keyboard.
- The shape of the tetromino coming next is displayed in the mini-grid.

## Tech used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Progress:
- [x] Update HTML to semantic syntax
- [x] Update JS based on HTML classes and ids
- [] Update CSS based on the box-model


I got inspired by this tutorial: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-by-creating-a-tetris-game/
